Limiting magnitude - Spectroscope									
Bowen's Formula								Corrected and revised April 2012	
									
Original formula:									
	m=12 + 2.5 log(( W* D1* Td* g* q* t* (dλ/dθ)/(f1* f2* H* α))							NB convert units to metres and radians	
									
	Where m is the limiting B magnitude to give a "usable spectrum"								
Note: This formula is presented out of historical interest. The calculated magnitudes are only estimates. First promolgated by Bowen in the 1940's									
									
Input:							Output:		
W	=$''.G19/1000000	Projected slit width at telescope focus				metre	mag lim	=14.1+1.2*LOG((B11*B12*B13*B14*B15*0.8*B16*B17)/(B18*B19*B20*B21),10)	
D1	=($''.G7/$''.G8)/1000	Diameter of collimator lens				metre			
Td	=$''.C7/1000	Clear aperture of telescope 				metre			
g	=$''.$G$43	Optical efficiency					Usually 0.1 to 0.5		
q	=$''.K9/100	Quantum efficiency of CCD							
t	=$''.K18	exposure (secs)				sec			
(dλ/dθ)	=$''.G14/1000/($''.G26*$''.G21)	dispersion of grating				m/rad	(dλ/dθ), also = d2/R		where d2 = exit beam reflected from the grating, R= Theoretical Resolving power
f1	=$''.G7/1000	focal length of collimator				metre			
f2	=$''.G12/1000	focal length of camera				metre			
a	=$''.C15*5/100000	star size (Rad)				Rad	(5 -20uRad = 1-4")		
H	=$''.K20*$''.K7/1000000	height of spectrum				metre	based on height of the spectrum ( height* pixel size)		
									
NB When slit is larger than star image, substitute Td= Td*Td,  ie magnitude proportional to Dt*Dt									
									
Comment:									
1. Limiting magnitude should be based on a value close to SNR =10									
2. The number of subs used for the exposure has an impact on the S/N ratio ie more subs gives lower S/N - this aspect is not included in Bowen's formulae.									
modified formula used:									
3. The Bowen formula doesn't handle well the various Bolometric corrections or the changes in stellar temperature.									
									
m=14.1 + 1.2 log(( W* D1* Td* g* q*0.8*t* (dλ/dθ)/(f1* f2* H* α))
