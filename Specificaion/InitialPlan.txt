SAS_NA1_3D_Spectrograph
=======================

Introducing the New GitHUB repo -- SAS_NA1_3D_Spectrograph

     https://github.com/dxwayne/SAS_NA1_3D_Spectrograph

In late May 2021 we need to deliver a paper and a working
spectrograph.  The paper's completion may preceed the final repo. At
the time of SAS we will change the "SAS_NA1_3D_Spectrograph" from
private to publicly accessible. Only we can change it. Any and Every
entity can get a copy.

To these ends the SAS_3D_Spectrograph repo will still hold our
experiments. The new SAS_NA1_3D_Spectrograph will hold the initial
release (taking place this week) and any changes forward from that
point.

So far the general hardware elements include:

 Progress      Description
    5      Housing with 30mm height for the optical axis
    8      Grating Rotator and IR sensor for position
    9      OVIO slit holder
    6      Colliminating Lens/CAM-focuser
    3      The Camera Lens
    6      Guide Camera/optics and mirror
    0      Mount to telescope
    0      Rotator for Parallatic Angle
    2      Calibration Lamps

Publication:
    0      The paper!
    0      Video Presentation(s)

           
Cad Packages/Files:
     Fusion/360  - recommended
     Solidworks  - recommended
     (others)    - tolerated
  Mandatory: STL files.
  Mandatory: Matched drawing file for package
  Mandatory: Matched SLDPART,etc file per package
  Mandatory: PDF with lots of dimensions.
  Mandatory: A ".rst" file for the Sphinx Doc (stored in docs)


Computing Platforms:
    Raspberry Pi
    ODroid
    Arduino:
        Nano BLE Sense 3V
        Xiao
        TBD


The layout of the repo will be:

Top level
  .git -- hiden revision history
  doc  -- RESERVED for Sphinx Documentation
      RST files, per section of the "manual"
      Photos/images/sketches/PDFs
     

  CAD (a subdir for each main functional element)
      Functional Element
         CAD files, mixed per element.

  Code:
       The code files will be organized along their own
       substructure. As libraries will exist, their format will not
       necessarily follow the mechanical form.  Language choices are
       open, preferably simplified C/C++ (Arduino); Python 3.8+, bash
       shell (as needed per platform)

  Design (documents):
       Spreadsheets as needed.
       Hand sketches are acceptable
