Basic 6-Inch LHires3
=====================

6-inch refractor with a Moonlite Express Night crawler focuser and
rotator. It will use a LHires3 spectrograph.

- heat the spectrograph. The spectrograph will have temperatue sensors
  for that purpose.

- focus the spectrograph

- remotely turn on the comp lamp, flat lamp and the slit led.

- a video finder that works when asked

-wider field camera to watch the dome slit that will take a short
  exposure image when asked.



A stretch goal: I want to mount a Apogee U8 + filter wheel and
a Mamiya RB67 lens for patrol of the spectrograph's fields.
This will utilize a Odroid with KStars/INDI

I want a power distribution box with 13+V in and regulated 12/5/3.3
V out.
